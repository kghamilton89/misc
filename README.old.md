# /mɪsk/

## Project Description

/mɪsk/ is a new kind of social media that focuses on user control and user privacy as first class citizens rather than empty platitudes.

- There is no algoritm that uses your data to recommend new topics
- There is no API to support user-agent automation

## Guiding Principles

/mɪsk/ is not a political or ideological movement, it is an earnest attempt to return to the internet what it has lost: genuine, human interaction.

- There is no subjective moderation
- There is no concept of privileged users
